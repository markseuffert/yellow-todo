# Ideas and tasks - Option B

This is a draft, the file will probably be deleted soon.

You can help us with the following ideas and tasks:

- [ ] Added support for light and dark mode to all themes.                      Commonly used on mobile devices
- [ ] Added support for installing extensions in web browser.                   Expected by many users - [see #991](https://github.com/datenstrom/community/discussions/991)
- [ ] Updated API, YellowPageCollection no longer derives from ArrayObject.     Strange PHP design feature
- [ ] Updated contact extension, message delivery with brute force protection.  Spammers gonna spam
- [ ] Updated edit extension, settings dialog with dropdown menus.              Complexity in user interface
- [x] Updated edit extension, upload with different JPEG file name extensions.  Mobile devices use them
- [ ] Updated icon extension, SVG stack instead of WOFF font.                   Consistency with other extensions
- [ ] Updated feed extension, short URL for the feed.xml.                       Long URL is disliked by some users
- [ ] Updated sitemap extension, short URL for the sitemap.xml.                 Long URL is disliked by some users
- [x] Removed googlecalendar, googlemap and youtube extension.                  Invasive services are bad - [see #1021](https://github.com/datenstrom/community/discussions/1021)
