# Product task list - Option B

This is a draft, the file will probably be deleted soon.

You can help us with the following tasks for Datenstrom Yellow:

- [ ] Added support for light and dark mode to all themes. Light and dark mode is expected on mobile devices.
- [ ] Added support for installing extensions in web browser. Users can't see and install extensions in browser. [#991](https://github.com/datenstrom/community/discussions/991)
- [ ] Updated API, YellowPageCollection no longer derives from ArrayObject.  PHP ArrayObject interface is strange. [#899](https://github.com/datenstrom/community/discussions/899)
- [ ] Updated contact extension, message delivery with brute force protection.  Spammers gonna spam.
- [ ] Updated edit extension, settings dialog with dropdown menus. Users can't change important system settings in browser.
- [x] Updated edit extension, upload with different JPEG file name extensions.  Mobile devices use different JPEG photos. 
- [ ] Updated icon extension, SVG stack instead of WOFF font. There's no consistency for symbol files across extensions.
- [ ] Updated feed extension, short URL for the feed.xml. Users don't like the long feed URL, it's kind of ugly. 
- [ ] Updated sitemap extension, short URL for the sitemap.xml. Users don't like the long sitemap URL, it's kind of ugly. 
- [x] Removed googlecalendar, googlemap and youtube extension. General dislike for invasive 3rd party services. [#1021](https://github.com/datenstrom/community/discussions/1021)
